            Hi! This is Sheetal Jain. Though, these two words “Rational” and
            “Reasonable” seem identical in meaning but they are drastically
            different. I wasn't aware of it before reading book “ The Psychology
            of Money" by Morgan Housel. While reading I came across to 11th
            chapter which was titled as “ Reasonable > Rational “. After reading
            I got to know that these two words have distinct meaning. Now, let
            me share what they mean to me.

            Technology has been surmounted in such a way that machines can work
            like human beings. Artificial intelligence is one such technology
            that has a tendency to cause a machine to work like a human. In
            today’s world remote surgery, self-driving cars, proving theorems,
            etc. have become a new revolution in AI. Artificial intelligence
            consists of two words “Artificial”, which means man-made, and
            “Intelligence”, which means thinking power.

          <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
            Before knowing why the rupee value increases and decreases, let us
            first understand the factors that determine the value of a currency
            against another currency. Like common goods, the value of a currency
            is determined by its supply and demand in the market. Whenever the
            supply of a good is more in the market i.e. the good is in abundance
            and hence the price of that good will be lower while whenever it is
            not sufficient in

            Words have power over everything. Word knowledge has always been in
            demand because whatever you learn you learn through words. Like if
            you study computer science, you learn words like constructor,
            destructor, cluster, object, nodes, packets, database, syntax etc.
            and if you study medical science you study words like neurology,
            psychiatrist, amygdala, epithelium, obstetrician, gynecologist,
            cardiograph, amputate etc.
